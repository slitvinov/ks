Fig. 6. Time evolution for the KS equation. Time runs from 0 at the
bottom of the ﬁgure to 150 at the top. This is a PDE example of
deterministic chaos [1].

Fig. 7. Matlab code to solve the KS equation and produce Figure
6. Despite the extraordinary sensitivity of this equation to
perturbations, this code computes correct results in less than 1
second on an 800 MHz Pentium machine.

Fig. 8. Time evolution for the Allen–Cahn equation. The x axis runs
from x = −1 to x = 1, and the t-axis runs from t = 0 to t = 70. The
initial hump is metastable and disappears near t = 45.

Fig. 9. Matlab code to solve the Allen–Cahn equation and produce
Figure 8. Again, this code takes less than 1 second to run on an 800
MHz Pentium machine.
